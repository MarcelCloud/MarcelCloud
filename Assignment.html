    <h2>How it started</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Ayorinde Tobiloba, ALT/SOE/023/2589 and this AltSchool journey started some
      2months ago when I first reached out to Hacksultan - Altschool's
      Co-founder. He told me about a 50% paid scholarship I stand to win if I
      register immediately pay the application fee. I promptly applied and here
      I am. I didn't I'd have enough time on my hand as a freelance content
      marketer but I decided to join in regardless. It's been hectic combining
      my current projects with AltSchool but I'll be honest, i've enjoyed every
      bit of it so far.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Altschool</h2>
    As I mentioned earlier, I work as a freelance content marketer and writer
    but my keen interest in Technology coupled with a BSC in chemical
    engineering meant I was destined to gravitate towards a code or
    no-code tech skill. I chose Cloud Engineering. Before Altschool, I was
    self-learning by taking courses on Coursera and Simplilearn and then, I
    quickly realized this would be a steep learning curve.

    Altschool offered a more convienient learning path and I'm happy I joined in. 
    <ul><li>Learning at ones own pace
    <li>Learning with a community of like-minded goal-getters</li>
    <li>An easy-to-understand LMS</li>
    <li>And most importantly, skilled tutors.</li></ul>

    At the end, I want to be equipped with the building block of cloud engineering that'll put me ahead of the curve in a fast-paced tech ecosystem.
